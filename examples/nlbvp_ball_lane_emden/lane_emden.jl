"""
Dedalus script solving the Lane-Emden equation. This script demonstrates
solving a spherically symmetric nonlinear boundary value problem inside the
ball. It should converge within roughly a dozen Newton iterations, and produces a
plot of the solution. It should take just a few seconds to run (serial only).

In astrophysics, the Lane-Emden equation is a dimensionless form of Poisson's
equation for the gravitational potential of a Newtonian self-gravitating,
spherically symmetric, polytropic fluid [1].

It is usually written as:
    lap(f) + f^n = 0
    f(r=0) = 1
    f(r=R) = 0
where n is the polytropic index, and the equation is solved over the interval
r=[0,R], where R is the n-dependent first zero of f(r).

Following [2], we rescale r by 1/R, giving:
    lap(f) + (R^2)*(f^n) = 0
    f(r=0) = 1
    f(r=1) = 0
This is a nonlinear eigenvalue problem over the unit ball, with the additional
boundary condition fixing the eigenvalue R.

We can eliminate R by rescaling f by R^(2/(n-1)), giving:
    lap(f) + f^n = 0
    f(r=1) = 0
and R can then be recovered from f(r=0) = R^(2/(n-1)).

For a scalar Laplacian in the ball, we need a single tau term. Here we choose
to lift it to the original (k=0) basis.

To run and plot:
    \$ julia lane_emden.jl
