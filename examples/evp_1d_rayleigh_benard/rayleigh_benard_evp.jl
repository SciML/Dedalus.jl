"""
Dedalus script for calculating the maximum linear growth rates in no-slip
Rayleigh-Benard convection over a range of horizontal wavenumbers. This script
demonstrates solving a 1D eigenvalue problem in a Cartesian domain. It can
be ran serially or in parallel, and produces a plot of the highest growth rate
found for each horizontal wavenumber. It should take a few seconds to run.

The problem is non-dimensionalized using the box height and freefall time, so
the resulting thermal diffusivity and viscosity are related to the Prandtl
and Rayleigh numbers as:

    kappa = (Rayleigh * Prandtl)^(-1/2)
    nu = (Rayleigh / Prandtl)^(-1/2)

For incompressible hydro with two boundaries, we need two tau terms for each the
velocity and buoyancy. Here we choose to use a first-order formulation, putting
one tau term each on auxiliary first-order gradient variables and the others in
the PDE, and lifting them all to the first derivative basis. This formulation puts
a tau term in the divergence constraint, as required for this geometry.

To run and plot using e.g. 4 processes:
